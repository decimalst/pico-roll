RPI Pico Dice Rolling Script

This is a simple script to emulate standard D&D style dice on a Raspberry Pi Pico.

To use this script, you'll need (a Pimoroni Pico Display pack 2.)[https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack-2-0?variant=39374122582099]
Once you have the Pimoroni micropython image flashed onto your pico, you can save this script as main.py onto the board to run it at boot.
